         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of <hi>EDWARD WILLIAMS,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Againſt a Bill cauſed to be brought to the Houſe of Peers by Mr. <hi>George Weld,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons, relating to the Cuſtody, Tuition, and Marriage of Sir <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> Baronet, an Infant of the Age of Thirteen Years and Ten Months.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Peter Pindar,</hi> Baronet, had Iſſue <hi>Thomas Pindar,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Charles Pindar,</hi> and three Daughters, whereof one married Mr. <hi>George Weld</hi> without her Father's conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Wynne,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſeized of an Eſtate of Inheritance, had Iſſue three Daughters, <hi>Ann, Mary,</hi> and <hi>Jane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Pindar,</hi> Eldeſt Son of Sir <hi>Peter Pindar,</hi> married <hi>Ann,</hi> the Eldeſt Daughter and ſole Heir to the Inheritance of <hi>Robert Wynne,</hi> and by her had Iſſue <hi>Paul Pindar,</hi> and one Daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Pindar</hi> in 1687. dyed in the Life-time of his Father.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1689. <hi>Ann Pindar,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Thomas Pindar,</hi> by her Will named and appointed <hi>Edward Williams,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (married to her Siſter <hi>Jane</hi>) <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe Thelwal,</hi> Eſquires Truſtees of her Eſtate, and Guardians to her Son Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> (then an Infant about Nine Years old) for his Benefit, and conmitted the Care of him to her ſaid Brother <hi>Edward Williams</hi> in her Life-time, and left the Infant in his actual Cuſtody at her Death in <hi>June</hi> 1690.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> her Brother took care of, and provided for her Funeral, Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> the Infant continuing in his actual Cuſtody with the conſent of the other Truſtees and Guardians; and having Interred the Mother, he Peaceably without any Force or Violence brought the Infant with him from the Funeral of his Mother in the Preſence, and with the Approbation of his Co-Truſtees and Guardians, to <hi>Place Ward,</hi> the late Houſe of <hi>William Williams,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in his way to Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> his Houſe, and within two days brought the Infant to his own Houſe, where he hath continued in good Health, and Educated agreeable to his Mothers Appointment, and his own Quality.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1690. Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> exhibited a Bill into the Court of Chancery againſt Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> in the Name of Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> the Infant, naming himſelf his <hi>Prochein Am,</hi> untruly ſuggeſting that Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> had by Violence ſeized the Infant, and detained him with an intent to diſpoſe of him in Marriage.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> anſwered that Bill, denying the Force and Violence, ſetting forth his Cuſtody of the Infant and Truſt under his ſaid Mother's Will and Appointment, ſhewing alſo tha he was Guardian in Soccage to the Infant.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of the Great Seal in <hi>February</hi> 1690. Aſſuming the Juriſdiction of the Court of Wards over the Eſtate and Perſon of this Infant, Ordered, That Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> ſhould Receive the Rents of the Infant's Maternal Eſtate, and Mr. <hi>Charles Pindar</hi> (the Infant's Uncle of the Father's ſide) ſhould Receive the Rents of the Infant's Paternal Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Soon afterward upon the Death of Mr. <hi>Charles Pindar,</hi> the Commiſſioners Appointed Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> Receiver of the Infant's Paternal Eſtate, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Jones</hi> to be Receiver of the Infant's Maternal Eſtate; and other Orders were made by the Commiſſioners in Relation to the Perſon and Education of the Infant.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> Humbly conceiving that the Court of Chancery had no Juriſdiction of the Perſon of the Infant, or Power over his Eſtate in this Caſe to controul the Mother's Will and Dſpoſition therein, and his Guardianſhip in Soccage, did in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Truſt in him repoſed and Guardianſhip, take care of the Perſon of the Infant, and of his Education.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> having received the Profits of his Eſtate all this tine without Account or Security for the Benefit of the Infant, or any Maintenance allowed him, though there's a Bill filed for tht purpoſe in the Infant's Name, Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> inſiſting upon his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
            <p>Now the Infant drawing near the Age of Fourteen, enabling him to chooſe a Guardian, Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> fearing he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to Account for what he hath Received out of the Infant's Eſtate, hath cauſed this Bill to be brought to the Houſe of Peers, Complaining that Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Williams</hi> by Force and Violence ſeized and carried away the Infant, and that he hath been detained by them ever ſince, in order to Mary him to a Daughter of the ſaid <hi>Edward Williams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Suggeſtions are notoriouſly untrue.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. It cannot be pretended that Mr. <hi>William Williams</hi> was concerned, or intermedled in any taking or detaining of the Infant, otherwiſe than that Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> and the Infant lay at his Houſe a Night or two in their way from Mrs. <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Funeral to Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> his Houſe. Mr. <hi>William Williams</hi> is a ſtranger to the Infant, and was ſo in <hi>June</hi> 1690. and hath ſo continued ever ſince without intermedling in any thing that concerns his Perſon, Eſtate, Cuſtody, or Marriage; he hath no Power over the Infant, neither hath he ſeen him ſince he was at his Houſe in <hi>June</hi> 1690.</item>
               <item>II. Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> had the actual Care and Cuſtody of the Infant's Perſon in the Life-time of his Mother, and hath continued ſo ever ſince, and doth Humbly inſiſt upon it, that he is Entituled to the Cuſtody of his Perſon, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of his Eſtate with the other Co-Truſtees, by the Appointment of his Mother's Will.</item>
               <item>III. He is alſo Entituled to the Cuſtody of the Infant as Guardian in Soccage, having married the Infant's Mother's Siſter.</item>
               <item>IV. The Infant is very well pleaſed with his being under the Management of Mr. <hi>Edward Williams,</hi> and has been very well Educated, and deſires to continue under the Care and Management of his Guardians appointed by his Mother's Will.</item>
               <item>V. There's no Ground for the Preſumption of his being married to Mr. <hi>Edward Williams</hi> his Daughter, it's rather to be ſuſpected and feared, that the Perſon who married his own Wife without her Father's Conſent, and Sollicites this Bill, would Marry this Infant to one of his Daughters, if he could get him into his Power, having already made a Marriage for one of his Daughters to an Infant Baronet, <unclear>unequal</unclear> in all reſpects, except the Infancy of the Perſons.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Wherefore it is Humbly hoped this Bill will be rejected.</p>
